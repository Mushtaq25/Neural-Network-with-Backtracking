# Neural-Network-with-Backtracking
It is a simple basic Neural Network with One Hidden Layer and One Output Layer <br>
Neurons in Hidden Layer = 400 <br>
Neurons in Output Layer = 10 <br>
The dataset file contains matrix X which is a training
data and size of the matrix is 5000 × 400. Each row represents a digit (ie. dimension of
digit image is 20 × 20) and there are 5000 samples to train, corresponding labels are given
in the vector y. <br>
The Dataset is in .mat file format <br>
please follow below instruction to load the images <br>

<i>->> from scipy.io import loadmat <br>
  ->>data_mat = loadmat('{file_firectory}') </i><br><br>
 Google Collab .ipynb file is available please follow <br>
